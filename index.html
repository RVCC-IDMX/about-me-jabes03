                <h2> Biography: </h2>

                       <div>

                        <p>Since I was younger I was always interested in technological advances, at the beginning I thought that everyone was interested, why wouldn't they be interested in the future, but as time went, I started to realize that not everyone is as interested as I am.</p> 
                        <p>At first, I started explaining features on my parents phones, they were not as interested as I was.</p> 
                        <p>People always say that kids are smarter and more interested in phones than older adults. But I was always more amazed than my friends by the characteristics that a phone or computer had.</p>
                        <p>I think that because I had my first computer and phone at a very older age, I wanted to use every part of the phone that I was "missing out" before having my own.</p>

                        <p>I also try to be an organized person. Every week I create a perfect plan on a calendar and I try to adhere to it most of the time</p>
                        <p>This is a habit that it could get toxic, specially for me, because while it is good that you organize your day, you can get anxious when things don't go exactly as you planned</p>
                        <p>I am still working on balancing my rest and my work time</p>

            <h2> Background image properties: repeat, size, position, origin, and clip. </h2>

            <div>

        <section id="blog_text">


            <p> Background images can attract the reader’s eyes to the content you want them to see, but they also can be obstructing the content you want them to see. </p>


            <p> Background images can attract the reader’s eyes to the content you want them to see, but they also can be obstructing the content you want them to see. </p>


            <p> Background images come with many properties so that you can attract your viewer’s eyes in different and creative ways. </p>
           
            <p> The picture of a field that is behind this text is an example of how this image can be used.</p>
           
            <p>But background images don’t already come perfectly placed for your text. According to W3 Schools (a website about online learning) “By default, a background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally. . .The background of an element is the total size of the element, including padding and border (but not the margin) . . . Always set a background-color to be used if the image is unavailable.” (W3Schools CSS background-image property). So there is some kind of tinkering you will need to do after you paste your background image. </p>
           
            <p> So if you want to add a background image to your text or the whole website, a simple </p>
           
           <p> body { </p>  
           <p>background-image:</p>
           <p>} </p>

        


<p> will not suffice. You will need to make use of the properties that come with the background images. If not, your background image will be a repeated image going downwards with the maximum opacity, making the text harder to read. As said in this website that helps you understand the coding rules “The background-repeat CSS property sets how background images are repeated. A background image can be repeated along the horizontal and vertical axes, or not repeated at all.” (MozDevNet). </p>
           
           
            <p> Some of the main properties background images have are the following: </p>
           
            <ul>
            <li> Repeat: “Sets if/how a background image will be repeated.”(W3Schools CSS)  </li>


            <li> Size: “Sets the size of the element's background image.” (MozDevNet)  </li>


            <li> Position: “Sets the initial position for each background image.” (MozDevNet) </li>


            <li> Origin: “Specifies the origin position (the background positioning area) of a background image.” (W3Schools CSS) </li>


            <li> Clip: “Sets whether an element's background extends underneath its border box, padding box, or content box.”(MozDevNet)</li>


            </ul>
           
            <p> As you can see, there is a big variety of things to do with the background image, and each property can achieve different goals.</p>


<p> But, background images do not only mean adding a graphic photo behind your text. You can also add plain colors so that the text can stand out. One famous example is in code. </p>


 <p> While coding, the background is usually black and the textual code is either white or gray. Like in the example below</p>

</section>



        <section id="sample_code">


            <p> <code> (body) Hello World (/body) </code></p>

</section>



<p> Another website that is famous for helping code says that "When coding a website, using an image as the background image of the website is different from inserting an image in HTML using the img element." (freeCodeCamp). If you are getting similar results with both adding a background images and a normal image, why would you add a background image.</p>
<p>You would because of the abundant options that adding a background image add to your website.</p>
